\section{Conclusion}
A clear and concise conclusion, containing key takeaways of the article or report. It is useful to give the readers a huge summary of what they just read, highlighting the main takeaway from the report. It should provide the key information that the author wishes the reader to remember most when reading the report. Although this sounds very similar to the abstract, this is generally true, but make sure the content of both the abstract and the conclusion do not overlap. Basically, the main body should have an elaborate discussion while summarised in the conclusion.
