Please note that some headlines could potentially fit into multiple categories; for example, headline 11 about Google unveiling a subsea cable could also be considered "business". I categorized it as "tech" due to the technological infrastructure focus. When such cases arise, the category with the most direct relation to the content is chosen based on the information provided in the headline."
