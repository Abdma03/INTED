"From the very beginning I had a love for math and science. I loved how the numbers just made sense in my mind and loathed the feeling of solving a complicated problem. I found myself asking my parents and teachers questions I had about the way the world worked and the inter-workings of different simple machines I encountered.

"I have always been interested in physics, since I enjoy reading, and often science-fiction isn`t very far off from the truth. As I got older, I began to read more fiction, especially regarding physics as it applies to space and the world around us. I soon found that I simply didn`t have enough education to solve the problems I wanted to, and decided it was time to continue my education. At that time, I was interested in obtaining a bachelors degree, and going into the field of theoretical physics, since I often watch scientific documentaries, and have always been fascinated with unsolved phenomena. I have a desire to further our understanding of the universe as a whole, and one day make an important contribution to the scientific community. I have always dreamed of solving conundrums related to dark matter and energy, and solving a true theory of everything. I began taking beginning physics courses(non-calculus) because I just wanted to jump right in, even though I did not yet have the math skills to take advanced physics courses. Since then, I have completed almost every math course I need to continue a serious physics education, and along the way encountered computer science(in particular Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning). I am currently a Junior, and will graduate by June 2020(although I am projected to finish early at this time). I have altered my educational goals slightly to include in-depth knowledge of computer science as well, because I think AI will be a very effective tool to help further scientific research and discovery in the realm of physics. I am currently learning how to do research, as I have just been accepted into the PSU University Research Mentorship Program, and will soon conduct a research project of my own.

"The fact that I am interested in science and have the courage to go for a degree in one of the least diverse fields out there is probably largely due to the fact that my parents have always stressed the importance of education in science. From before I knew what physics was, my parents had both my brother and I watch Bill Nye the science guy on a fairly regular basis and made it so that it was not unusual to talk about science or math at the dinner table. As a matter of fact, it was generally strange if we didn???t. However, my brother always did more in the sciences when we were young, as I was in remedial math (and reading) classes throughout elementary school and always felt that I just wasn???t good at science or math. My brother was smart; I was cute. Even so, during middle school this mindset changed once I noticed that I did have potential where not I nor anyone else thought I did.The first time I considered becoming a physics major was a while ago, when I was still in middle school. Somehow, between fifth and sixth grade, I suddenly jumped between being in remedial classes to being in all honors classes, which opened up opportunities for me to delve into science. In my seventh grade honors science class, it was required that each student complete a science fair project and enter it into the fair. I conducted a project in physics (signal processing regarding how the waveforms of violinists differ) and managed to win awards all the way up to the state level, which is as far as you can go in the state of Texas at that age. This positive experience with science led me into telling people I wanted to be a physicist, and it gave me the confidence to more seriously think about the field. Throughout the end of middle school and into high school--when I attended a sub-par public school in rural Oklahoma--, I read physics books and magazines in my spare time, and being interested in the field became normal to me. I then applied and was accepted to the Oklahoma School of Science and Mathematics, where I was able to take seven physics classes and math through multivariable calculus during my junior and senior years of high school. I declared physics as my major almost immediately after starting my time at Stanford University, and have stuck with it, even though I???m not entirely sure of the details of what I want to do after college.

I don`t particularly remember enjoying the subject, but I absolutely loved my teacher, Ms. Ortman, who made the class exciting. Due to this, I took physics my junior year in the hopes of having her as a teacher again, which I did. During a lab, in which the class had to calculate when to launch a projectile in order to hit a moving object with a constant velocity, I decided that this was what I wanted to do with my life. I loved how seemingly simple calculations translated into real life motion and events. Due to this, I proceeded to take AP Physics my senior year of high school, which only confirmed my desire to major in this field, as I excelled in the class. However, the weekend before the AP Test, I contracted a horrible sinus infection, but took the test anyways, and received a 4 on both the Physics C Mechanics and Electricity and Magnetism tests. Honestly I was a little disappointed, but I felt that if I could do that well when sick, then I certainly could go further with physics. The following summer, at my orientation at MSU, I was set on continuing on to the next physics class, but the lack of math credits kept me from taking the nest course. So, I decided to retake the Mechanics and E&M 1 my freshmen year in order to maintain a strong base in physics. Currently in my freshmen year, I am maintaining a high grade in my physics course, and helping my sister(who is a junior in college) with the concepts in her introductory physics course. I also attend the meetings for the Society of Physics Students and the Astronomy Club; both which help me to further my physics knowledge through guest speakers and presentations.

I was discouraged from taking Calculus and Astronomy my first semester by college mentors, which ticked me off a bit because those were the classes that I really wanted to take but these college mentors, who were biology students, kind of influenced me with an iron fist to take the classes that they thought were best, and I had to go along with it and I had no way to change my schedule. So, half-way along through the semester I learned that they were having an EYH, Expanding Your Horizon`s, women`s conference that I could teach at. I ended up teaching a program about astrophysics and cosmology, because I knew a lot about it and it was fun. The program didn`t have any other program besides biology or chemistry related programs, so I decided to do with astrophysics one. After teaching at that conference, I decided that I did not want to go into microbiology because it was not challenging enough for me and it wasn`t what I wanted to do. So I decided to switch my major to physics, and I signed up for the appropriate classes for the following semester, and I also decided to volunteer at the ASP and at our local observatory.

"Both of my parents were born in Los Alamos, and 3/4 of my grandparents worked for Los Alamos National Labs during the Manhattan Project. My first memory of anything physics-related was during the last years of the Cold War, standing in front of the replicas of the Fat Man and Little Boy casings. I was probably 7, and put together that these relatively tiny objects had all but leveled cities that were not significantly different from the one I was living in - I understood, all at once, the implication of E=mc^2, and knew that my family was somehow involved in carnage depicted in the photos of post-bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki.For many years after that, I tried to not think about physics - I studied anything and everything, fairly seriously pursued art & music and read constantly on a wide variety of subjects.At some point in my early 20s it became clear that I needed, to whatever extent possible, to understand this thing my family had helped create. I started reading anything I could find that was related: the histories leading up to World War II, the complicated interplay of nationalism and fear that allowed the Nazis to come to power and anything else I could find that explored the stakes involved in the decision to attempt building a nuclear weapon. Then I needed to understand how the bomb was built; I started reading history and pop science books specifically about the Manhattan Project. A few years later, I realized it had been over two years since I`d read a book that wasn`t about physics. I also noticed that my focus had broadened - reading about the Manhattan Project had lead to reading about nuclear physics which had lead to reading about quantum mechanics and from there things were getting decidedly out of hand. The problem was that my pile of books was getting bigger and bigger, but the additional depth of understanding was decreasing with each one I read - these were pop science books, after all. That is: it was rapidly becoming clear that the level of understanding I wanted was not available between the covers of any pop science book. Within six months of this realization, I had enrolled at my local community college and started taking the math pre-reqs I needed for calculus-based physics courses.

"I spent three semesters as a West Point cadet. My third semester was rough. I was very depressed, thousands of miles from home, and growing increasingly interested in a civilian guy who was not supportive of me staying in the Army. My grades were slipping and my desire to stay was waning. I tried to see an Army psychiatrist, but I realized quickly that she was assessing my fitness for the Army more than she was trying to help me. My introductory physics instructor was a major in the Air Force who was in the process of transitioning to civilian life. I had stopped turning in homework for his class. He knew I was intelligent and knew that I was more than capable of turning in my homework and doing well in his class. He eventually reported me to my TAC officer, and I received 5 walking hours as punishment. I resented him initially for doing this, but I am now extraordinarily thankful that he sent the negative report to my TAC officer. The walking hours were a wake up call, and I snapped back into doing my work and studying kinematics. I did eventually leave the Academy at the end of that third semester. At the very end, my physics instructor made me sit down and chat with him. I hadn`t told him half of what was going on, but he was intelligent enough to read the subtleties. He told me a story about another female cadet he and his family had grown close to who wanted to leave the Academy because of an unsupportive girlfriend. He inspired a great deal of confidence in me when I felt like I had none. When I decided to attend BSU last year, I thought about my physics instructor at West Point, and I just knew I could do physics long term.

I ended up choosing Physics as a major because I thought it would help me build a good base of knowledge from which I could jump off to excel in anything else I wanted, and because I had always been interested in learning about how things work and the secrets and limits of the universe.  My very first physics course in my second year of college was tough.  I was dealing with a severe family issue at that time, had just left a three year romantic relationship, and was struggling with depression and anxiety (as I have been throughout college).  I nearly failed the course but managed to pass it with the help of an amazing TA, who ended up dropping out of graduate school to focus on his music but continued to encourage me to keep going in physics.  I didn`t really interact with any of my professors or other students at that time, so he was the first person in Physics I really talked to and he made me feel confident and capable, answering all my questions with enthusiasm and telling me I was smart and inquisitive and that he really hoped I decided to continue with physics.  When I joined SPS and started making friends in physics, I felt more like a part of the community and more excited about studying physics.  The previous CUWiP conferences I have been to have been invaluable in renewing both my passion for physics and my confidence that I can succeed in Physics.","Intrinsic Value, Media Triggered, Cost (Outside Effort), Social Persuasion, Event Triggered, Intrinsic (Social)",0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,

"In high school I was interested in physics but did not excel in my physics course. I think my B+ grade performance (not bad but not my best) in high school physics was attributable to two factors: one, I was deeply afraid of asking questions for fear of sounding dumb, and two, the course was algebra-based and glossed over proper derivation (derivation of key equations helps me to understand and accept equations).In college I didn`t consider physics until I became good friends with a physics major. They talked about physics in a way that completely changed my perception of the subject. This change in perception, along with newfound math skills, led me to realize that I deeply missed physics.

Initially I changed my major from environmental science to geology, mostly because the geology major allowed me to take more math and physics courses. I was beginning to realize that physics was my true interest, but when I expressed my interests to family and friends, there was pushback. First of all, my friends couldn`t believe that I was suddenly so interested in physics, considering that I didn`t take to it so much in high school. I was warned against switching to physics. People said it would be too hard, or that I wouldn`t get a job. When I met with the undergraduate physics advisor, she warned me that sometimes students would come to her in tears. They were failing the courses they loved so much. But I knew already that I would not be fulfilled if I did not quickly and completely explore this strong pull towards physics.

"How I got here is significant to understanding who I am. My whole life I wanted to be a scientist. However, I was strongly discouraged from a young age. Partially because I was not born into an environment that accepted the idea of women in science and because of my unusual performance in school. When I was a young I had extreme trouble in school but exhibited exceptional verbal communication skills for a child and an unusually strong talent for realistic drawing. When I was nine I was diagnosed with severe dyslexia, ADHD, and an anxiety disorder. The guidance counselor who informed my parents told them I wouldnÕt be able to graduate high school and should focus on art due to my aptitude in drawing. What no one understood at the time was that my aptitude for drawing was not the result of an interest in the arts, but rather an interest in geometry and the problem-solving aspect of finding the shapes within a more complex figure. I grew up trying to prove people wrong about my potential but also trying to compensate for my struggle in the classroom. Not believing I could go into science I tried to focus on design in high school. Despite what the counselor said, I did graduate high school and got accepted to a good architecture school. I attended for one year and realized no matter how hard I tried to believe I loved architecture, my passion would always be in science. So, a few days before I was supposed to go back for my second year, I gathered the courage to do what I had wanted to do for a long time: I withdrew from architecture school and registered at PCC to study physics and eventually transfer to a four-year university to complete a degree in astrophysics.

"My dad is an engineer and we???ve always connected over our love for science so I grew up with a general interest in the sciences. In elementry school they started to divide the students based on mathematical aptitude, I was placed in the accelerated learning section. This made me feel capable and since then it has been a part of my identity. I can do math and do it well. This was reafirmed by the fact that my father was good at math too so I could see where it could take me because he has a very successful career. These were all impressions made on me before or during middle school. After that it was just claiming my place in every math and science course there, if I had any doubts about my abilities I don???t think I would have made it this far because I occasionally ran into sterotyping, which was a driving force in proving them wrong.

Because of this and my general aptitute (which I feel many women have, but the don???t identify with) I have always been at the top of my class. After completing the first 2 years of undergrad I took some time off of school because my competitive nature was unsustainable. I needed to be inspired by more to succeed and have an impact on the world as a scientist, so I traveled and explored who I wanted to be in this world in this one life I have. I came back to the same conclusion that I want to be a physicist, but this time it wasn???t to prove to people that their presumptions about me are wrong, but because I know I can make a contribution.

"I remember from a very young (elementary student) age being very interested in science in general. I was always intrigued as to how things worked and asking `why`, much to my parents` annoyance. However, even at age thirteen I only had a vague idea of the field of Physics. I certainly didn`t know anyone who had studied physics, or even science. I thought science was mainly what I would now consider biology and I knew I didn`t want to study that long term. One day I saw an advert in my local newspaper for a series of public science talks, and suggested to my parents that I`d like to go. They dutifully took me and I sat enthralled as a physicist described both his work and how we could prove that man really had landed on the moon through physics. I felt that I had finally found the career I wanted (which I had no idea had existed before that evening), a field that used both my maths skills and my curiosity for how the universe worked.Over the next couple of years, I continued maths class with an excellent teacher in a small `gifted and talented` group of eight, which really pushed me mathematically, I struggled a lot with the rigorous curriculum and being in a class of high-achievers, but I believe it taught me to persevere with maths and problem solving. However, at age 16, and partly due to familial pressure to `get a degree that will lead to a job`, I was split between physics (which by then I knew was where my true interest lay) and engineering (which I liked less but lead to a more obvious career). Luckily I then was placed in a class with an excellent, interesting Physics teacher for the first time, and he encouraged me that I could study physics at university and that I had the ability. He also nominated me for an award from a scholarship trust in the UK, and that lead me to physics-based residentials and more public lectures. As is the UK system, I then applied for university as a physics student. I really believe that it was excellent teaching and, equally, encouragement that lead me to being a physics student. I found the mathematical treatment of the universe fascinating, but I doubt I would have ever gone on to study Physics at university without excellent maths and physics teaching and two teachers who explicitly told me I had the ability to.","Intrinsic Value, Event Triggered, Vicarious Experience, Cost (Emotional), Social Persuasion",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,

After I decided to go to Fresno Statemainly to continue with the music program I was familiar withI started to love my intro physics courses more than mymusic courses. Learning the in-depth theory deconstructedthe emotional side of music and made it too roboticand formulaic for me to enjoy it. However, putting formulasand theory behind the physical world made me love learningabout physics more (what a weird paradox) because I couldquantify the world around me. I eventually decided to drop the music major and stickwith just physics. It seems like physics is one of the majors in college that are really worth the time and money.It`s hard to learn it by yourself, especially if youhave an inadequate background like myself. The average joedoesn`t really care about physics so a university is oneof the most accessible places I could think of to interact with people who cared about physics.I enjoy my professors and fellow students and departmentas a whole.

Before that, I knew I would be a scientist, so I could be able to find things out from myself instead of only reading about them and depending on the findings of others. With this in mind I decided as a child to be a scientist. Since I was attracted to the notion of studying animals in the jungle, and, later, watching the Teaching Company Great Courses lectures by Dr. Sapolsky on human behavioural biology, I thought of studying animal behaviour or neurobiology. But since Biology felt incomplete - it wouldn`t give you an understanding of the fundamentals of matter - I kept physics. To think about not studying physics feels like committing to a life of ignorance, even though I;m currently in a phase where I feel I have no real love of the subject, only a love for the idea of the subject, and for some of the things it can do for you. That begin said, I have only a fuzzy idea what the life of a researcher is like. It feels boring, in the fact that they seem mostly sedentary beasts, but interesting in that they are on a noble quest, and a hard one at that. Influences have included: my parents, who have always plied us with educational material and who homeschooled me for the first 11 years of my life, Carl Sagan and his captivating voice and dreams of other worlds -he spoke especially to the explorer in me; Neil DeGrasse Tyson; my best friend in High school now studying physics at Georgetown. I am very much a product of attempts to inspire popular interest in science. At current I am a physics major because I hope to develop a means of transportation sufficient to hop between galaxies, a la Star Trek, and because I want some engineering know how as well. The obstacles include my not begin overly fond of the work we`re doing in class now on mechanics, and being dubious about how much I`ll like further work. I am considering strongly a career as an Astronaut, and a doctorate in physics would help meet entry requirements.","Intrinsic Value (Astronomy), Intrinsic Value, Social Persuasion, Media Triggered, Vicarious Experience, Utility Value",0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,

I had a difficult time in high school with math and science, so when I decided to pursue a degree in chemistry at Brockport, I knew that it wouldn???t be easy.

"I always had low expectations for myself and my abilities, so out of high school I initially pursued something that seemed ""doable"" for myself, such as personal training, because that depended more on physical ability and experience, rather than intelligence. The stronger I got in the gym, the more I was able to conceptualize what hard work really looked like, and the expectations I had for myself began to grow. I had decided to pursue firefighting, which required I take an EMS program. During the course of this program I noticed myself out performing many of the other classmates, and began to suspect that perhaps I had been severely underestimating myself. Ultimately I realized that my failures in the past were due to a misunderstanding of what hard work and ambition really looked like, so during the process of becoming a fire fighter I was forced to reconsider my future and determine my true limits. I decided to change directions entirely and pursue something science-related and to see where that would take me. After completing my first calculus course I realized that perhaps I could do more than I ever thought before. It`s been a long road, and I still have a long ways to go with respect to behavior modifications, but I am certain I`ve made the right choice with applied physics.

My homeroom teacher taught it at the time so I talked with him about it and he told me that those courses were difficult and most people didn`t take them at the same time. It felt like he was trying to discourage me so I promised myself that I would take those courses no matter what. When the time came, I took both of them, loved them both, and ended up excelling. I could take pride in it since my homeroom teacher had also told me that I had great potential and I never used it. After those classes, I felt like I had finally accomplished something.When I actually started university, I came in as undecided. They automatically put you on a Mechanical Engineering track. My first day of class, it was like, what am I doing here? This is definitely not for me. So I ended up following a Math, Physics, and Chemistry-based track. I was still undecided but I had a better idea of what I wanted. As I followed along it for a year and a half, I realized that there was plenty of math in physics and chemistry. So now it was down to two. But how to choose? I liked how physics had a wide variety of applications but chemistry seemed like a crazy, mind-blowing field of its own. So I talked about it some more, and I mulled things over. I came to the conclusion that I was stuck. I had decided that I might prefer physics a bit more, but a part of me believed that I couldn`t get the skills, that I wasn`t good enough to figure it out, to understand. Then, I had someone who showed just enough confidence in me that I felt that I could. Because why not?

A sphere moving through a plane would look like a circle that is changing sizes from the planeÕs point of view.

"I began my study of physics in my sophomore year of high school. At the start, I was terrible at it. I did not understand how to turn a concept, say, an object ???just leaving the ground,??? into an equation: normal force = 0N. As simple as this conversion may seem to me now, it was incredibly hard to learn. I felt like I was being taught to think ??? really think ??? for the first time. It was no longer enough to simply state that something was happening. I was forced to consider why that event had occurred and what that information meant with respect to a whole situation: the ice melts, the block falls, the car makes the turn safely. After I learned to think in the way physics demands, I was free to enjoy the amazing discoveries it has to offer. I was, and am, absolutely fascinated with the ideas of electron tunneling, Heisenberg???s uncertainty principle, Schrodinger???s cat, and everything I have learned so far about quantum physics and general relativity. The day I learned about Young???s double slit experiment being done with a single photon, I knew I wanted to be a physics major. Out of everything I have learned in the past three years studying physics, the one subject that has been demonstrated repeatedly is that there is so much we have yet to learn. I want to be a part of future discoveries. I want to study physics because I think the universe is incredible and mysterious and I am excited to learn more about it. Every time one discovers an answer to a physics question, he/she unearths a dozen more questions about the subject. Physics is a continuous cycle of discovery and curiosity. They feed off each other ??? curiosity prompting discovery and discovery furthering curiosity. Some may find that cycle tiring, but I find it enthralling.

"In 2nd grade, we had a science unit on astronomy. We learned about the solar system and phases of the moon, and I found myself actively engaged and interested in school for the first time. I decided to be an astronomer, watching documentaries on space in my free time. I started applying myself in school, reading unassigned chapters of our science textbooks, checking out books on science from the school library, and memorizing extraneous pieces of information on science topics. By middle school I recognized I was good at math, so I decided I would be an astrophysicist because it sounded more involved. My physical sciences teacher in 8th grade gave me a fuller understanding of what physics was. Space as a whole started to feel like it wasnÕt as relevant as other branches of science to understanding everything around us. I decided to be a physicist so I could understand everything, and have the flexibility to specialize in something later on.Unlike most of my classmates I went straight into honors physics my sophomore year. I was 1 of 5 sophomores taking that class, and thus felt isolated. I barely talked during lab and did every assignment without help from study groups. At the end of the year my teacher needed an idea of the number of AP physics books required for the oncoming year. Although terrified at the prospect of underperforming, I raised my hand. The next year, I was the only junior and the only female in the AP physics class. I didn`t know anyone, but they were engaging and non-competitive so I felt more comfortable than the year before. As a senior and only AP physics ÒveteranÓ at the school, I became a TA for my physics teacher. In college IÕve tried harder right off the bat to develop a sense of camaraderie with my classmates. Labs became fun and I learned how to come off as confident without appearing unapproachable. I know how it feels to be isolated, so I try to seem friendly to others who may need help.","Intrinsic Value (Astronomy), Media Triggered, Vicarious Experience, Cost (Emotional)",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,

This initiated a paradigm shift in how I approached physics as a discipline. In achieving the status of an aesthetic subject, my relation to physics was transformed. It was no longer simply an option for the types of puzzles with which to occupy my time.

The field of science, though interesting to all of them, wasn`t really a part of their lives. So, to encourage me in the scientific field, they allowed me to experiment with kits that they found at Hobby Lobby, or similar places.) Learning, more than anything, was the majordriving force in my life from an early age. I soaked up information. Bill Nye and Mrs. Frizzle were my best friends on the television, when I stopped long enough to watch them.Going into middle school, the school counselor recognizedme as an intelligent child. She attempted to get me into theschools` Gifted/Talented program, but I was not able to pass the entrance test for the program. (Our school only offered an artistically talented program, and I am partially colorblind. The portion of the test requiring the student to recognize patterns in blocks that were similarly coloredwas the only portion of the test that I did poorly on, butit was enough to keep me from getting into the program.)So, I began to read, avidly. Forgoing classes (I stayed ina seat in the back of the classroom, and kept my nose firmly in a book), I began to work my way through the library. My grades were decent. I didn`t fail any classes.But, I did read. I read through the library. History, geography, astronomy, fiction, science fiction, non fiction,there was not a single subject left unexplored. I couldn`tsoak up information fast enough! After high school, I wenton to college, starting with a junior college near home.Looking through the various majors, I settled on nanotechnology. It looked interesting.Though I did marvelously well in nanotechnology, my classin Physics did not go so well. To be honest, I just got scared.I felt like I couldn`t understand the subject, and that maybe I wasn`t as intelligent as everyone told me I was my wholelife. So, I looked back through the majors and changed over to Information Technology. I could be a librarian! I likedbooks, so that must be perfect for me! After a semester going in that direction, my mother reminded me that, as anintrovert, I do not like dealing with people. Perhaps I should reconsider a scientific field again.

"The start of my interest in astrophysics is likely similar to that of many other students, faculty, and researchers in the field.  I think a curiosity towards the universe is shared by everyone.  To an uninformed observer, the night sky is beautiful, with its twinkling flecks of light, our glowing moon, the occasional asteroid, perhaps, on rare occasion, a supernova near enough to be seen with the naked eye.  To an informed observer, however, the night sky is sublime, terrifying, unimaginably complex, unbelievably enormous, and hardly understood.  It`s not hard to fall in love with astronomy, and I too fell victim to it`s compelling, mysterious pull.  With this passion for the universe, I began taking as many classes as I could in astronomy.  I had an excellent astronomy teacher in high school, who happened to also be my physics teacher.  Every other weekend, he would host star parties in the hills of Santa Cruz.  He would use his telescope to show us planets, nebulae, and other interesting celestial objects.  He was the final push I needed to pursue astrophysics in college.  My love for physics blossomed in college, as I quickly learned that everything I see and feel is governed by a set of all-powerful laws.  My love for research and spectroscopy blossomed when I was introduced to the three spectroscopists I`m lucky enough to call my mentors.

The professor did not explain concepts very well, and was unsympathetic to the fact that I had no knowledge or experience of how to handle college-level courses. It was a very time-consuming and negative experience.I decided to branch out and try intro biology and physics classes my sophomore year. I was drawn to physics because I enjoy being logical. My physics classes required applying fundamental laws to different situations, whereas biology leaned much more towards memorization and facts without deep understanding of the mechanisms behind biological processes.In addition, the physics department was very encouraging and felt like a positive, tight-knit community. I started doing research the second semester of sophomore year, despite only having taken one introductory class. I conducted research in a polymer physics lab under the mentorship of Peggy Cebe, a strong female role model in an otherwise male department.I also took Professor Cebe`s biophysics course. Being able to use my biology and chemistry knowledge while applying the rigor and logic of physics greatly excited me.

"I can honestly say that next to engineering, physics is one of the most exciting for me in life. I first learned physics around 5 or 6 years of age when my mother brought me a physics kit for ToysRUs. Back then, I hardly knew the basics, just that stuff moved and did things and that always seemed pretty cool, but I was dying to learn more. It wasnÕt until I was older and I got to study Newtonian physics and the basics that I truly fell in love with physics. The ability to understand and describe the world around me in way that that I could quantify amazed me and left me craving even more answers to some of lifeÕs biggest questions. When I met my high school physics teacher, he inspired me even more. He noticed a potential in me that I couldnÕt see and even though I wasnÕt the best at math (just good enough to pass with high marks), he believed and encouraged me to keep seeking answers to those burning questions that my family or friends cared nothing about. As far as inspiration, I would say my physics teacher coupled with my momÕs support in all my endeavors motivated me along with my natural curiosity and stubbornness for answers. I hope to go onto medical school after undergrad or a graduate program and do research in medical physics or biophysics, particularly with cancer research or something trauma related, but my main goal is to get an M.D and Ph.D so I can treat patients and conduct research. If I donÕt get a chance to get an M.D, I want to pursue medical physics so that I can still contribute to both the physics and medical communities.  Additionally, I would love to learn more about experimental and theoretical physics as my knowledge of those subjects are not highly extensive. Overall, physics is still fairly new to me (despite being a physics major for 3 semesters) and IÕm just taking my first steps in a long journey to find something that I would be more than happy to do with the rest of my life.","Intrinsic Value, Social Persuasion, Utility Value, Intrinsic Value (Medical)",0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,

I was raised with the idea that oneshould never claim to be above average at anything, andthat you will most likely fail if attempting a difficulttask or profession. Whether the cultural aspect is alsocorrelated with gender is unclear due to the sample size.The largest influence on my change of major was winninga championship in Thai Boxing, odd as that sounds. I`m extremely short (around 5` 1"") with a very strong build,so I was consistently at a range (arm/leg length) disadvantage in bouts. When I won the championship against a person who had that natural advantage, I decided that an increase in effortcould offset my perceived disadvantage in natural intellect.

In my second experience with the Fordyce lab at Stanford, I applied my knowledge of optics, physics, and chemistry to fabricate new microfluidic devices to generate complex droplets for biological micro-reactions. I planned my own experiments for the first time and even built a device-operation setup, which resulted in co-authorship on a publication.

Since I was bright and curious no one ever discouraged me and I always assumed I would be able to attend college and become a scientist as I was growing up, but that dream quickly fell away once I reached High School. My family life was very unstable, and in order to ensure my security, I dropped out of school in order to get a job. Though I was unable to pursue an education for many years, astronomy remained a passion and a great source of comfort in my life. No matter how bad things seemed, staring up into a sky full of stars always put my mind at ease. Still, it saddened me to celebrate scientific discoveries from the sidelines, especially since I was painfully aware that my lack of mathematical fluency excluded me even further as an observer. After finally creating my own stable home life, I was able to begin school at my local community college. I quickly found that my determination and curiosity quickly outpaced even my natural aptitude, and for once my dream seemed within reach. My goal is to take my education as far as I can. I want to go to grad school because I feel it will test the limits of my capacity for knowledge. I want to do research not so much for the discovery, but for the process of problem solving and the experience of working on a team of like minded people. Ultimately I want to teach.

This is very different from a normal lecture. In a modeling class, the professor does not lecture, and does not provide information to the students; instead, the professor sets up a basic problem and lets the students think for themselves until they come up with a logical explanation to natural phenomena. The professor is merely there to guide the students and stop them from venturing too far from the solution. After the students come up with a viable solution, they also had to come up with an experiment to test said solution. This went on until the students reached the best possible solution.
