Amazon alwaysdelivers. I'm a very busy person that don't have time to go out and shop. so I turn to Amazon to deliver my things and they do. from groceries to things I need for my remodeled restroom. ,5
"Shop Amazon often. Always prompt deliveries. Always what I ordered. Thank you"","" Amazon!",5
I love your thing you sell,5
Trash,1
"Robbed"","" again. Unfortunately I need to work full time and that means I need to sleep. Meanwhile the hoards of heroin junkies wander the streets stealing any packages they want with absolutely no consequences but me? I get to waste my hard earned money and time being stolen from by both the losers and Amazon. It's sad and I hope everyone involved gets cancer. Back again to say I've been robbed again. No option for money back even tho the item I ordered wasn't in the package at all.",1
"Option mpesa payments big market"","""","""","". Appreciate if you see need.",5
Amazon is the best online shopping app in the wolrd,5
"What is going on???????!!!! Since yesterday"","" when i try to buy something"","" a series of silly dogs appear on the screen. It's my money not good anymore"","" dudes?",1
No option to dissable interruptive ai chat bot that takes up screen space. Claims to have dropped off items missing from open package. Provides no recourse. Expects me to return items I never recieved to get replacement or refund.,1
always great. my preferred shopping method,5
deliveries are good but they leave sometimes at the front door when not knocking at the door wait for the person to answer it,5
It would be 5. Because Amazon is my go to place to shop. But every time it offers a free trial of prime and I go to the Google play store it doesn't activate. Why is it connected with the Google store??,3
Can't do password,3
"The app works ok most of the time but honestly... Amazon delivery has gone seriously down hill. There's no where to add feedback with Amazon in general"","" so here goes.....the delivery has changed for the worst"","" Hermes"","" Evri"","" Royal mail all seem to be struggling. Deliveries are now commonly late"","" notifications are all over the place and inaccurate. Are they overworked and underpaid? I suspect this is the case. Amazon prime shopping"","" is no longer a reliable marketplace.",2
Came with my phone and can't uninstall it. Even if disabled it still wastes 30MB of space for no good reason,1
I like the simplicity of shopping at amazon,5
love it. simple and easy,5
"Amazon India: one of the worst customer service experience ever. Recently I had to order the same phone twice"","" yet Amazon can't help debit the right payment mor deliver my phone on tome. It's simply horrible horrible horrible.",1
App not working for some reason,1
"I ordered the Holy Stone GPS Drone with 4K UHD Camera and a type C adapter"","" expecting them to arrive on time as indicated. Unfortunately"","" the drone was delivered six hours late"","" and the type C adapter was delayed by an entire day. As someone who works and lives in Mt. Rainier"","" time is of the essence. I waited as long as I could"","" but the items arrived too late for my needs. To make matters worse all anybody from amazon could say is pick up your item like they didn't just hear me say I can't",1
"If nothing else"","" I will give it this. It's incredibly convenient and easy. I've yet to find something they don't have and most often they have exactly what I'm looking for and very often at a better price.",5
Doesnt show show tracking updates. Please never use USPS ever they always very late and loose packages,2
Very helpful and convenient,4
Very bad,1
Everything I have ordered has arrived on time and is always good quality products for a great price. I love Amazon Prime!!!,5
The app is awesome,5
Doesn't work,1
Ever since the last update is an EBT customer when I submit my order in the grocery part of the app for Amazon Fresh it does not allow me to put in my PIN number for my EBT card the first time. I have to wait for a message from Amazon in my email saying my order was canceled. After that I have to put place items in new cart and update payment method which was the same method as I was using before. This is time consuming and makes no sense. Charges 9.99/mo for free delivery over $35. GREEDY AF!,2
Get Rufus out of my face. The amount of screen space in the app is limited enough,3
Thank you for all you do at Amazon.,5
"Watch ordering when you have multiple addresses in your membership. My Amazon membership is in MY name"","" I had chosen MY billing address & I had ordered VERY recently from them for a delivery to ME. So why the app chose my sister's address to receive the most recent order"","" I have no idea. It's a serious glitch. I have had to remove all of my sister's information"","" but I am very leery about ordering from them again at this point"","" especially since the cost is still pending.",4
Wow they can't make it run as smooth as bezos head but oh well as long as he gets paid right. You don't need a quality product to be successful I guess.,1
after delivery i will tell about everything,4
"I am absolutely blown away with this app"","" you guys are honestly the only shopping app I go through now when it comes to shopping. I have looked on other shopping apps"","" and honestly no other apps beats the Amazon shopping app. Period",5
"I'm disappointed because I have bought so much stuff from them .Some of my packages have been delivered partially open"","" and I mentioned this on the product review .All of a sudden"","" I was blockedòí from putting any review on a product that I bought because I exposed the fact that some of my packages had been partly opened. A lot of the products have sent me $10 -$30 reward cards that I can't use .This block policy needs to be changed"","" especially when you put money in their pockets .",3
They told me my delivery was coming 15th June But still not deliver,1
so convenient!,5
Nightmare,1
I love it,5
always great products,5
Works as expected.,5
Love to shop with hubby's money,5

"amazon I'd quite nice for shopping"","" tbh and I never had problem if u need to faind or help with something...thankbyou",4
love the convenience. bring on the coupons,4
Please make is avaliable for sri lanka as well like Ali express we could order,1
It's Amazon. Efficient and user friendly app as expected.,5
Good,5
"Great selection"","" unfortunately for me it will basically block me out if my Internet is a little slow.",3
Amazon took my gift card and won't let me use it at all and was no help in solving the problem.,1
I absolutely love it!,5
"I placed an order almost two weeks ago"","" and I paid for it"","" it accepts my card and then a few days later it's payment declined or on hold..I'm not happy about this"","" it told me it was arriving today and then I get a message saying on hold.",1
In the last month ive had several items that didn't arrive on time or weren't shipped at all. They refuse to cancel the order or give a refund,1
Amazon's cash grab adding ad's to prime video is trash. Recommendn you skip prime; the value is not worth the price. Pure greed. Spend your money on one of the other streaming services. They have better content.,1
I need the ai search in the question box to show results from within reviews. The checkout process is aweful. Screams scammy wants you to mess up -Go back to the old design. There are 2 your lists buttons and thats a mess of a page too. The whole thing is a HOT MESS. Worse us looking at photos in reviews w the drop down text box. Repulsive design it lags forever cant quickly scroll thru pics,2
"Needs major help with ui and ux. Just go to settings and see how many options there are. Least intuitive app I have. This is elementary school bologna"","" richest guy in the world lol what a joke",1
"I love amazon. The app is extremely intuitive and works well. Very happy with the ecosystem"","" very happy with the user friendly features and ability to shop quickly and easily. App functions as expected without problems. 10/10 experience"","" 5 stars.",5
Good delivery,5
You all have good stuff and on time,5
I like,5
"Okay so they told me to create a new account I've tried multiple times in the past hour"","" thay keep saying internal error this problem has not been fixed for about a year or so now so I guess my using Amazon to buy books is over...",1
Always easy to use!,5
Very good quick delivery,5
"I tried buying two items. My card was locked at the time"","" but when i unlocked it to update payment"","" it just added a different order with the same items. So I canceled one of the orders and tried getting a hold of support. There is basically no option to talk about whatever with a real person unless you look into subcategories"","" which I find dumb. After some time"","" I got support"","" and they said they'd be able to reorder the order that got canceled. I was supposed to get an email but haven't so far.",2
"fast"","" reliable and if there is a return"","" it can happen quickly.",5
amazing,5
I always have a great shopping experience with Amazon.,5
Most of the time it's great. The only real issue I have is losing packages because delivery drivers are either incapable or unwilling to read the delivery instructions,3
"Stop video auto play once and for all. Down vote this app"","" everybody.",1
Great app!!!,5
Prices aren't as good as they used to be..,3
can find anything you need,5
Good so far,4
Just amazing...,5
good app,5
my back up boo,5
Google play will continue to charge you even after a cancelled membership remember to cancel your subscription in Google play as well. Smh just had the worst customer service call with Amazon rep an I deeply appreciate how sweet he was with me because I was upset. I however love the Amazon prime membership it's faster delivery and you save money they find you better deals.,5
Nive,5
Always great,5
Awesome,5
worst experience ever,1
"Easy"","" fast and wonderful prices and if you need to return something is easy as well"","" AMAZON IS THE BEST",5
You Need To Add a sort option where you can sort your cart by price low to high or high to low.,4
Being housebound means that I am dependent on online shopping.Amazon are and have been a lifeline for me. So thank you Amazon,5
Whats with the whole food returns and now you want to charge me $1 for ups return even when its your fault. I'm a paying prime customer and should be able to return a damaged item at no cost to myself as I do not have a whole foods near. So I guess I need to cancel services with amazon and go buy my stuff somewhere else. Not going to be a paying customer of amazon if I gotta keep paying for returns that are not my fault too many items coming damaged latley.,1
"OK app for shopping UNTIL AMAZON MAKES A MISTAKE & SOMETHING GOES WRONG. Amazon moved back our delivery date. I saw the problem coming. I called and tried to explain we will have started our vacation by the new delivery date. (There have been a lot of package thefts in our area.) On Days 1 - 4 three different Amazon reps did not give a damn"","" flat out lied"","" and said there was nothing they could do. On Day 5 a helpful rep who gave a damn entered a Stop and Return Request. Praying that worksüôèüôèüôè",1
Best app,5
Excellent service,5
love the fast free shipping?,5
Amazing caring love you,1
"No Dark Mode Option On This App"","" What A Joke. We Have To Go On Google With Forced Dark Mode To Use Amazon Shopping!!!",1
"Amazon sucks"","" they can't even deliver a package on time"","" or at all. They said my package was delivered but it's not"","" now they won't admit they lost my packages. NO MORE AMAZON FOR ME.",1
"Bad ui"","" slow respond",2
too many feedback requests,3
don't need this app,1
because there is a minimum amount for same day delivery for prime members or pay $2.99 . not right,2
"RUFUS AI.... PRIVACY INVASION!!! HOPE AMAZON HAS BILLIONS FOR CLASS ACTION DEFENSE. IN ADDITION"","" IT DOESN'T EVEN WORK...LOL. WORST IDEA EVER... MFGDPOS!!!! GET IT OUT OF APP!!!!",1
Great,5
"I enjoy shopping with Amazon! it's easy"","" convenient"","" excellent prices for quality products and if you are not satisfied they give you ample time to return your merchandise in good order.

"It is impossible to contact support. They have recently canceled my account event"","" though I was able to provide the submission and added a side comment for clarification on the card I was using.

cool app,5
fab.u.lous!!!!,5
"I have never had a problem with the app? It is strange that"","" soon as you want to spend money computers work fine and dandy.",5
Great experience,2
Love my Amazon app. Best shopping app on the market.,5
I can get virtually anything I need at Amazon within 24hrs or a few days,5
It's 2024 and Amazon being the biggest online retailer still can't figure out dark mode,1
Excellent,5
Now that you can't buy music or books in the apps there isn't a reason to use the app.,2
Boycott,1
Rufus needs to go....so annoying.,4
"Stop saying it's out for delivery if it's not actually out for delivery. Clean up the mess of a user interface. Get rid of the hordes of knock-off garbage. Make the search function actually work"","" or stop calling it a search function",1
"Aftwr ~1 year usage"","" Great customer support",5
Very difficult to find place where to change country and language when once automatically change from default to something else when clicking weblink. If i want to change from USA back to German Amazon. Finally find it from person tab top right flag picture.,1
New AI (Rufus) is incredibly obnoxious and buggy. Either polish it or get rid of it. Don't force half baked AI into everything just to keep up with the other corpos,1
Kept going to Amazon us despite wanting to use Amazon sg. No way to switch it back to Amazon sg,2
"App is very buggy"","" and lists third party sellers from China before legitimate products. Basically more expensive Temu at this point. I'd definitely recommend training your AI better and becoming more restrictive on what content you allow to be sold on your marketplace.",3
"Good app with a smooth flow. I'm kinda online shopoholic so I'm a regular shopper at the app. I've not found many challenges but only one"","" hard to find a way to contact a customer service rep.",5
"Worst customer service Products get updated as delivered without actual delivery"","" and worst customer service.",1
I cant even use a gift card to purchase anything without it telling me I don't have enough when im making a $20 purchase with $100,1
This app has become all but unusable with RUFUS added. No option to out out very intrusive AI chatbot pops up every single time i go to an items store page i have to close it every time if i accidentally click near the bottom of page it pops back up again it's the most annoying thing ever. I'm uninstalling until i hear about Rufus has been removed,1
I love it,5
"Now amazon customer service so bad "","" really hard to contact them and they never answer you back. I am so regret to order a lot from them. We should go to the store to support not amazon",1
Works fine. Easy to use layout of store. Makes me spend lots. :),5
Pushing back the date on an item I paid to get early is just unacceptable,1
"I don't know why you feel it's necessary to HAVE USPS smash my daughter prom dress in the mailbox but when this white Karen across the street order packages smaller than ours she get a respected door delivery. Not my fault my children are not ivf babies and she mad now stalking my delivery and purchases over here on the Southside of lansing"","" michigan. Maybe if they stop worrying about my ""black"" culture purchase which is purchased with my money things will be okay. Stop leaking information. TF",1
"Sudden 33% Prime Subscription Increase is very harsh in this economy"","" while Amazon are making outlandish profit. Usually good service and customer resolutions. I don't agree with billionaires existing"","" or unethical working conditions. There should be profit limits so the money goes back into society and the environment This app also needs dark mode. And the Prime video menu is slow and clunky.",2
Great..,5
"Estimate 60% orders not delivered"","" indicated it was refunded"","" only 1 order was refunded.",3
F your ads,1
When I ordered a drone they sent me mason jar sealer. Took to long to get another label just to end up shipping it back. Hope they don't mess up on the same order twice.,2
awesome,5
Keeps saying internal error,1
"I love Amazon I buy anything from Amazon I know they will have it. It beats shopping at a store sometime they might have it"",""but then they might not. Amazon a good company",5
Keeps crashing. EVERYTIME I use it,1
Not a safe place to purchase discount trading card boxes. The site is filled with scammers. Be careful. All I'm saying. Customer service is subpar to say the least.,1
No theming hurts my eyes. Blaring white screen is burning my retinas. There used to be a dark option. Even eBay has theming. App is functional but now it's annoying.,1
"1. Primary address should ALWAYS be default. Selecting another address for an order"","" should NOT make it the default on the next purchase. This mistake on a same day delivery means cancelation is unlikely to happen. Now I have stuff headed to a hotel I stayed in last week ü§® 2. Grouping orders by shipping date within the order makes it hard to edit a large order"","" they dont alway ship together anyway"","" so... Orders should groupBy order_id. A 'Purchases' page could groupBy delivery_date",2
Boycott,1
I am not able to create account on amazon this is ridiculous what do you mean Pakistani people are not able to create account on Amazon,1
"Customer service refuses to fix known wide spread issue. Manager confirmed the issue was known"","" is currently a problem for many people regarding the store card and app functionality. Bad work on this one.",1
Doesn't allow you to delete and automatically opens links to the app instead of in browser,1
Great so far,5
She's Shopping On Amazon because she like buying stuff for me,5
Awsome!!,5
Love amazon. Great products and the customer service is amazing.,5
I hate it,1
"Rating the app and not Amazon itself as a company"","" the combination of long load times and notable severe lag when trying to scroll through photo reviews on a very snappy phone just shows poor optimization and app issues.",2
"This app takes up a chunk of space in my phone that could be utilized for better things. I no longer shop Amazon and one reason is because I am forced to have their app on my phone"","" you cannot remove it and free up space. Amazon is an awful company anyways so no love lost there.",1
I think I like temu better! 1 : Amazon never brought my order and I just feel like it's a scam! Temu never scammed me and always brought my orders! There is a lot of stuff it's not worth but in temu it's worth it! Amazon just haves expensive stuff that's not worth it. I don't like Amazon. I never really receive my orders. And They didn't even return my money!!,1
"When Amazon asks to write a review and you write a sincere one they do not post if the review hurts their sellers"","" this is very bad to convey the bad products to other costumers.",1
Excellent,5
Do not buy amazon gift cards from a store. You are at risk of buying a card that has already been claimed and amazon will do nothing to help you!,2
"The service is very"","" very bad. I contacted the administration several times"","" and no one responded to me despite a wait that lasted two and a half months. But eventually I deleted the app because I no longer trusted Amazon üíî",1

Everytime i pre order something they charge me same day and then claim 3 monthe later that they didnt even tho its clear as day on my bank statement... my point is never pre order from Amazon.. they will lie to you and tell you its your fault.. amazon your a con artist.. i wont ever give you another penny and im canceling my card so yall cant get anymore. ..so disappointing.. ive lost all hope in amazon.. there is absolutely no reason to pay for prime when they cant uphold the 2 day delivery,1

Excellent price range for gifts.,5
Great service,5

"By far the worst delivery service in Singapore"","" zero integrity",1
Amazon is just fantastic and never had any real issue for all the years ive used them...my only niggle is that recently searching and loading etc has started to show some reduction in speed. But that just made me realise that even superman is vulnerable at times.,5
"Adding items to Basket"","" but when I open the basket"","" it's empty"","" even though it's showing items number at the bottom. ?! I also had to sign in twice for some dumb reason.

very convenient,5
Two stars. Still no dark mode in the year 2024. It's absolutely ridiculous. ADD DARK MODE.,2
"I did at price comparison with just three items at Walmart and Target Amazon fresh was three to 4 times the price on the same item.

Amazon does not refund money please be aware this is a scam app!,1
